# StructureQL

Structure QL, not to be confused with Structured Query Language (SQL) (Could not come up with a better name for now). Is a small frame work targeted at enabling REST/HTTP framworks to ease implementation of partial returns based on structured data, currently aimed specifically at JSON.
